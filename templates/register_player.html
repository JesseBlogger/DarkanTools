                  I try to make sure all active players are able to see their xp gains
                  on the site. Here you can add any existing player. I will not ask for
                  any emails or passwords, as your account safety is most important. In the
                  future I may do account verification through the API through some specific
                  process like, "kill a chicken NPC with a random amount of GP in your first
                  inventory slot, something like that.
